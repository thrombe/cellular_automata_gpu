    . look for wasm examples in wgpu

custom commands:
  . /// import ./shader_path
    . keep track of what files included and dont import files multiple times
  . /// compute_enable
  . /// work_group_count 64

bugs:
  . 

plan:
  . add a texture + set alive cell coord texture as 1.0 or something. and subtract 0.01 from every other
    cell until it reaches 0
    . this would prevent the damage caused by the oscillators
    . + this would look good + small cells
  . add button for randomised cells
  . add a tick variable in stuff
    . if tick is true, then do the calc. else just return color (to prevent the processing that happens currently if stuff.tick_time > 0)
  . add torus
  . processing multiple generations per frame
    . an odd number of generations would be easy as the i wont need to edit the buffer swaapping code
    . make a func to get what buffer should be used
  . impliment in compute shader such that only one compute instanciation is needed per cell (not per pixel)
  . add different algorithms like bbrain
  . try the cellular automata from the sabestian lague vids
  . try the slime mould stuff from sabestian lague vids
